# Balanced Recall

Teleport to your spawnpoint in a balanced way.

This mod requires [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) and the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).

#### Features


**Magic Mirror**

Using the magic mirror will teleport you to your spawnpoint from anywhere in the same dimension. It has 256 charges, and can be recharged at a smithing table with an ender pearl. If it runs out of charges, rather than breaking, it will simply cease to function until recharged.


**Dimensional Mirror**

The dimensional mirror is identical to the magic mirror, except it has twice the durability and can travel between dimensions.


**Sleeping Mat**

The sleeping mat allows you to skip the night without having to place down a bed and set your spawn. Be warned, though, sleeping on this rough straw-padded bamboo mat is not enough to ward off phantoms. The sleeping mat has 128 durability.
