# Balanced Recall

*Mirrors and a mat*

This mod requires [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) and the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).

## Features


**Magic Mirror**

Using the magic mirror will teleport you to your spawnpoint from anywhere in the same dimension. It has 256 charges, and can be repaired with an ender pearl. If it runs out of charges, rather than breaking, it will simply cease to function until recharged.


**Dimensional Mirror**

The dimensional mirror is identical to the magic mirror, except it has twice the charges and can travel between dimensions.


**Sleeping Mat**

The sleeping mat allows you to skip the night without setting your spawn. Be warned, though, sleeping on this rough straw-padded bamboo mat is not enough to ward off phantoms. The sleeping mat has 128 uses and cannot be repaired.
